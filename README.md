# socR
An R package used to analyze SOCcer results

Right now the package mainly handles cross walking, but in the future I will add calling SOCcer directly. I'm looking to get the java code to run in R.  I will add an API call as a temporary fix.

[Have a problem?](https://github.com/danielruss/socR/issues)

## How to install
if you don't have the devtools package installed, install that first...

```
install.packages("devtools)
```

then

```
library(devtools)
install_github("danielruss/socR")
```
