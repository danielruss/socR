An R package used to analyze SOCcer results

socR is centered around codingsystems and crosswalking between codingsystems. It's still in development so it is likely to change often.

## How to install

if you don't have the devtools package installed, install that first...

```         
install.packages("devtools)
```

then

```         
library(devtools)
install_github("danielruss/socR")
```
