\title{Use the concordance table (crosswalk) to convert from one
coding system to another.}
\usage{
crosswalk(codes, xwalk, invert = FALSE, unlist = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{codes}{the vector of codes that will be crosswalked}

\item{xwalk}{the concordance table.}

\item{invert}{by default the crosswalk goes from codes1 to
codes2 setting invert to TRUE make the crosswalk go from codes2
to codes1}

\item{unlist}{instead of returning a list, return an unamed vector
use it when crosswalking a dataframe column with mutate}
}
\value{
an unnamed list of codes in the resulting coding system
}
